The internet is full of “too good to be true” offers. Here’s how to avoid getting scammed:

- **Unrealistic discounts** (90 % off smartphones?) → Probably fake.  
- **Poorly designed sites** or typos in URLs.  
- **No HTTPS padlock** in the browser bar.  
- **Seller ratings**: Always check feedback, return rate.  
- **Payment methods**: Avoid sellers who ask for mobile money only—use escrow or PayPal for buyer protection.  

> **Example:** A “Ksh 5,000 iPhone” link is almost certainly phishing.
